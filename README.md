# Learn NumPy


### For the official NumPy documentation visit numpy.org/doc/stable.

**NumPy** is an open source project that enables numerical computing with Python. It was created in 2005 building on the early work of the Numeric and Numarray libraries. NumPy will always be 100% open source software and free for all to use. It is released under the liberal terms of the [modified BSD license](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).

## Install
The only prerequisite for installing NumPy is Python itself. If you don’t have Python yet and want the simplest way to get started, we recommend you use the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/data-science-platform)_ - it includes Python, NumPy, and many other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

NumPy can be installed with conda, with pip, with a package manager on macOS and Linux, or from [source](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/building.html). For more detailed instructions, consult our [Python and NumPy installation guide below](https://numpy.org/install/#python-numpy-install-guide).

### `Conda`

```sh
# Best practice, use an environment rather than install in the base env
conda create -n my-env
conda activate my-env
# If you want to install from conda-forge
conda config --env --add channels conda-forge
# The actual install command
conda install numpy
```

### `PIP`

If you use pip, you can install NumPy with:

```sh
pip install numpy
```

## Beginners
